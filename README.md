Welcome to the **Polars Data Manipulation** repository! This project demonstrates various techniques for handling and analyzing **large-scale datasets** using **Polars**, a high-performance DataFrame library written in Rust.

## **Why Polars?**
Polars is designed for **speed**, **efficiency**, and **scalability**, making it ideal for working with large datasets. Unlike traditional tools like Pandas, Polars:
- **Processes data faster** using multi-threading.
- **Uses less memory**, thanks to its Arrow-based columnar data structure.
- Supports **lazy execution** for optimal performance.
